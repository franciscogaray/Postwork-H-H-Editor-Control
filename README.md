# Postwork-H-H-Editor-Control
A lightweight, standalone WordPress plugin developed for Heirloom &amp; Hops to manage editor stability. This utility allows administrators to toggle between the Gutenberg Block Editor and the Classic Editor globally or on a per-post-type basis, ensuring that legacy layouts and custom meta boxes do not break.
